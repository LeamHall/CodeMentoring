# CodeMentoring

High level guidelines for mentoring coders

## Attitude
Beginner's Mind

Humility

Service - to your mentor, mentee, fellow learners, and the project.


## Code of Conduct
For example:
    https://www.python.org/psf/conduct/


## Project Guidelines
Use your languages coding standards (PEP-8)?

What human language will you communicate in?

How much testing? How much documentation?

Stick to the core language, standard library, or any third-party stuff?


## Group Dynamics

Barriers to entry: how much must a new member already know?

Exit strategy: when is the participation "done"? Time, tasks, tests?

## Goals and Timelines
What is everyone trying to accomplish?

What is feasible, giving time allowed?

How is progress measured?
